!begin_node Cookie, _5MS

On Atari hardware, the 200 Hz system timer is implemented with the MFP
Timer C. Its interrupt vector is located at address 0x114.

On non-Atari hardware, the 200 Hz system timer is implemented differently, 
and may use a different interrupt vector. In this case, the _5MS cookie is 
set with the address of that vector. Then it can be used by FreeMiNT to hook 
the system timer on non-Atari hardware.
